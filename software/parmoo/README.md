# ParMOO in BAND 

ParMOO is a Python library for parallel multiobjective simulation optimization. It seeks to exploit simulation-based structure in objective and constraint functions by building surrogate models of simulation outputs separately from objectives and constraints. 

A [BAND SDK v0.2 Community Policy](/resources/sdkpolicies/bandsdk.md) compatibility documentation for ParMOO is contained in [parmoo-bandsdk.md](/software/parmoo/parmoo-bandsdk.md).

After covering basic installation and usage, here we provide a short tutorial from the [ParMOO Solver Farm](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/) that illustrates how ParMOO can be deployed on problems such as the calibration of energy density functionals. 

## ParMOO Installation

Complete installation and testing details for ParMOO are available at the [ParMOO repo](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo). ParMOO documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://parmoo.readthedocs.io/).

The easiest way to get a minimal installation of ParMOO is via the Python package index, PyPI (commonly called pip):

```
pip install < --user > parmoo
```
where the braces around `< --user >` indicate that the `--user` flag is optional.

For a full installation with all dependencies, including ``libEnsemble``, use:

```
pip install < --user > "parmoo[extras]"
```

You can also clone ParMOO from our GitHub_ and ``pip`` install it
in-place, so that you can easily pull the latest version or checkout
the ``develop`` branch for pre-release features.
On Debian-based systems with a bash shell, this looks like:


```
git clone https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo
cd parmoo
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, the latest release of ParMOO (including all required and
optional dependencies) can be installed from the ``conda-forge`` channel using:


```
conda install --channel=conda-forge parmoo
```

Before doing so, it is recommended to create a new conda environment using:


```
conda create --name channel-name
conda activate channel-name
```

For additional information, see [ParMOO's installation docs](https://parmoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## ParMOO Tutorial: Calibrating a NN Surrogate of the Fayans Energy Density Functional

To try calibrating a Fayans EDF with ParMOO, clone the [Fayans Model Calibration example](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/tree/main/fayans-model-calibration-2024) from the [ParMOO Solver Farm](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/):
```
git clone https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm
```

From within the subdirectory ``parmoo-solver-farm/fayans-model-calibration-2024``, make sure that all of the dependencies for this example are installed via:
```
python3 -m pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

Test installation and execution by running:
```
python3 parmoo_fayans_test.py --comms local --nworkers 4
```

Running the above test produces a CSV file containing ParMOO's final database of design parameter and objective values in `fayans_test_results.csv` and saves a pairwise scatter plot of the Pareto front in `Pareto Front.png`, which should look similar (i.e., small differences will be seen because of the randomization internal to these routines; reproducibility may be obtained on your machine by fixing the numpy random number generator seed) to

See the code in [`parmoo_fayans_test.py`](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/blob/main/fayans-model-calibration-2024/parmoo_fayans_test.py) for more details on how to reproduce these results, and see the file [`parmoo_fayans_structured_solver.py`](https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo-solver-farm/blob/main/fayans-model-calibration-2024/parmoo_fayans_structured_solver.py) for an example of a production-ready structure-exploiting run.

Details on this problem, which involves a surrogate of the Fayans functional, can be found in Section 5 of the preprint [ArXiv:2304.06881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06881).
