The  directory `main_programs/` includes some sample main programs. These are short programs that link to the libraries in the `software/` directory. They are placed in the local directory with the idea that the user may well wish to copy and modify some of these main programs for their specific purposes.

The directory `fakefullmodels/` contains a fake `rhic` model used for tutorial purposes.

Compiled codes are in `bin/`.
