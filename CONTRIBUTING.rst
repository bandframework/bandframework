Contributing to the BAND Framework
==================================

Contributions of source code, documentations, and fixes are happily
accepted via github merge requests. Please see

  https://bandframework.github.io/software/
  
for a discussion of the process.

If you are planning a contribution, reporting bugs, or suggesting features, we encourage you to discuss
the concept by opening a github issue at

  https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework/issues
  
or by emailing members of the `BAND
<https://bandframework.github.io/team/>`_ 
and interacting with us to ensure that your effort is well-directed.

Authorship
----------
BAND expects new major version releases of the framework to occur annually. 

Status as a named coauthor will be granted for those who:
1. make significant contributions to the Framework (in implementation, documentation, conceptualization, review, etc.) and
2. maintain and support those contributions.
    
BAND's Design and Oversight Committee (DOC) will do their best to notice when contributions reach this level by editing `AUTHORS <https://github.com/bandframework/bandframework/blob/main/AUTHORS>`_, but please email or create an issue if you believe your contributions have met these criteria and haven't yet been acknowledged.

Coauthorship is expected to persist in all future releases, with new contributors being appended to the list of authors. If contributors decline to be listed as coauthors, they will be acknowledged in the repository, manual, and release notes.
